# rust-webvr
WebVR Core API implementation for servo. We're working on integrating this core module into the Servo browser architecture.

This module can be tested outside of Servo and even be used as a simple to use VR API on any Rust standalone app which uses native Rust code and native OpenGL calls. It contains a full working OpenVR implementation.

## Room Scale example: 

Just run this command in the main folder

```
cargo run --example room
```
